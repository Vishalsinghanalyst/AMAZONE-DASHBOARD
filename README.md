THERE IS THE KEY FEATURS I CAN TRY TO SHOW AND INCESE THE SALLS.
1. Yearly Sales: It shows how much was sold each year between 2014 and 2017.

2. Sales Forecast: This part guesses how future sales might look (though I couldn’t see exact details here).

3. Products Sold: A total of 9,994 products were sold during this time.

4. Target Achieved: The company aimed for sales worth 48,000, and they hit the goal with no gap or variance (pretty spot-on!).

5. Product Returns: Out of all sales, 296 items were returned.

6. Sales by Customer Types: There’s a pie chart showing who bought the most stuff:

   Consumers (regular buyers): About 19%

   Corporate (business buyers): 51%

   Home Office: 31%

7. Sales by Market Locations: Another pie chart shows where sales came from. Most sales came from Yucaipa (about 82%), while York brought in the least (less than 1%).

8. Products Losing Money: A bar chart points out which products made the least profit (like "Canon 10 Gum").

9. Top Customers: It highlights big spenders who brought in the most profit, with Tamara Chand at the top (₹9,000).

10. Best-Selling Products: The chart also shows the superstar products. For example, Canon printers made the most profit (₹25,000).
